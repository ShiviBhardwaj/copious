# Monorepo Copious API

## Overview

This monorepo serves as a centralized repository for managing a collection of Copious microservices and reusable libraries. The project follows a modular architecture, where each microservice represents a distinct business domain or functionality, while libraries provide shared functionality and utilities across services.

### Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**:
    - The monorepo is organized into separate modules for each microservice and library, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment.

- **Microservices**:
    - Each microservice is a standalone Spring Boot application, encapsulating specific business logic and domain models. They communicate via RESTful APIs or message queues.

- **Reusability**:
    - Libraries contain reusable components, such as custom security modules, data access utilities, and common business logic, shared among microservices.

- **Consistent Development Workflow**:
    - Developers can work on multiple microservices and libraries within the same repository, streamlining code management and collaboration.

- **Scalability and Maintainability**:
    - The monorepo facilitates the addition of new microservices and libraries while maintaining a consistent codebase. It enables easy refactoring, updates, and bug fixes across the entire system.

### Purpose

The primary goal of this monorepo is to provide a unified platform for developing, testing, and deploying Copious microservices and libraries within a single ecosystem. It aims to:

- Simplify development by centralizing code management and version control.
- Encourage code reuse and maintainability through shared libraries and modular microservices.
- Enable rapid prototyping and deployment of new services while ensuring consistency and scalability.

### Project Structure

The monorepo is structured into the following directories:

- `services/`:
    - Contains individual microservice projects, each representing a specific business domain or functional area.

- `libs/`:
    - Houses reusable libraries and shared components used by multiple microservices.

- `common/`:
    - Stores common configurations, utilities, and shared resources utilized across the entire project.

### Tech Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Java**:
    - Core programming language for developing microservices and libraries.

- **Spring Boot**:
    - Framework for building standalone, production-ready microservices with ease.

- **Spring Cloud**:
    - Provides tools and libraries for building cloud-native microservices, such as service discovery, configuration management, and circuit breakers.

- **Docker**:
    - Containerization technology for packaging microservices into lightweight, portable containers.

- **Kubernetes**:
    - Container orchestration platform for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

### Contributions and Guidelines

Developers are encouraged to contribute to the monorepo by following these guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch for new developments.
- Adhere to the coding standards and guidelines specified in the project.
- Submit pull requests for code review and approval by the project maintainers.

### Getting Started

To get started with the development environment setup, refer to the individual README files within each service or library directory.

## Framework Choices

- **AOP**:
  - AspectJ provides more advanced features and Spring Boot starter AOP provides only limited functionality. [Details](docs/aop-readme.md)
- **Logging**:
  - Logback is the default framework provided by Spring Boot, able to fulfill the requirements.[Details](docs/logging-readme.md)
